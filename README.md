# npfic is Node Promises Flow Iteration Control.

This is a pure native javascript ES6/2015 function library with no third party deps which
provides you the following functionality:
* Apply an asynchronous proccess to all items of an iterable structure like an array, with failure
  tolerance.

This means you can apply the asynchronous proccess to all items at once, and when all of them
  finish, continue doing more stuff.
